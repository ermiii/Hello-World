        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
          Abiy is the thirteenth child to his father and was the sixth and youngest child of his mother. His childhood name was Abiyot, meaning Revolution, in Amharic, a name that was sometimes given to children in the aftermath of the Derg revolution of 1974.The
          then Abiyot went to the local primary school and later continued his studies at secondary schools in Agaro town. Abiy, according to several personal reports, was always very interested in his own education and later in his life also encouraged
          others to learn and to improve. While serving in the Ethiopian National Defense Force, Abiy received his first degree, a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering[10] from the Microlink Information Technology College in Addis Ababa in 2001.
          In 2005, Abiy earned a post-graduate certificate in Cryptography at Machine Dynamics in Pretoria, Republic of South Africa (AES encryption based on block cipher). Abiy holds a Master of Arts in Transformational Leadership and Change[10] with
          Merit, earned from the Business School at Greenwich University, London, in collaboration with the International Leadership Institute, Addis Ababa, in 2011. He also holds a Master of Business Administration from the Leadstar College of Management
          and Leadership in Addis Ababa in partnership with Ashland University in 2013. Abiy, who had started his Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) work several years ago as a regular student, completed his PhD in 2017 at the Institute for Peace and Security
          Studies, Addis Ababa University. He did his PhD work on the Agaro constituency with the PhD thesis entitled “Social Capital and its Role in Traditional Conflict Resolution in Ethiopia: The Case of Inter-Religious Conflict In Jimma Zone state”.
          As a follow-up to his PhD thesis, he published a research article on de-escalation strategies in the Horn of Africa Bulletin in a special journal issue dedicated to countering violent extremism.

            <h2> Military Career</h2>
            In 1991, the OPDO or the Oromo People’s Democratic Organization gained prominence largely due to the violent disagreements between the EPRDF and the OLF. The OPDO was seen by some as a peaceful alternative and this is more than likely the reason why Abiy
            Ahmed chose to join them at such a young age. Some might say he was looking for a way to end the violence and find peaceful methods of resolving the conflicts plaguing the country. One of Abiy’s close friends became the personal chauffer of
            Abadula Gemeda, one of the founders of the OPDO, and through this opportunity, it is believed they first crossed paths. It appears that Abiy began his career as a radio operator for the OPDO and with the downfall of the Derg he took formal
            military training at the Assefa Brigade in Western Wollega with a focus on Radio Communications and Military Intelligence. The OPDO at the time was made up of a very small number of soldiers and members, somewhere around only 200, while the
            TPLF had soldiers upwards of 90,000 men and the rest of the coalition making up the remaining 10,000. In order for Abiy to advance in his career within the military it was a strategic move by him to study Tigrigna, as the new Ethiopian Defense
            Forces were largely made up of the TPLF fighters. By 1995, undoubtedly, he impressed his superiors with his above average dedication to learning and he was seen fit enough to be sent to Rwanda on an important mission. Rwanda at the time was
            reeling from a devastating genocide that saw the massacre of close to a million people. The genocide caused by the Hutus against the Tutsis must have been a valuable lesson for Abiy, it showed how neighbors, classmates, and coworkers can turn
            on each other with a message other than love being disseminated. He spent the next few years as a peace keeping officer for the UN force in Kigali, Rwanda. By 1998, soon after his return to Ethiopia, he was deployed to aid his country in the
            Ethio-Eritrea border war. He was put in charge of an intelligence and communications unit that’s mission was to observe, analyze, detect, and report positions of the Eritrean military. A stalemate followed the war with Eritrea, and in 2001
            Abiy while still serving in the army received a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from a well known private IT college in Addis Ababa, called Microlink. Abiy followed his first degree swiftly with a post-graduate certificate in 2005
            from a South African school called Machihe Dynamics in Cryptography (focusing on AES encryption based block cipher). While serving in the army, Abiy met his wife Zinash Tayachew and they went on to have three daughters together.

                  <li>By <strong>2008</strong>, Abiy decided it was time for him to expand his horizons and he left the Ethiopian Defense Forces as a Major, although it is also claimed he reached the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.

                        in 2010, to resolve the conflict, federal authorities chose Abiy Ahmed then 34 years old, to represent them and bring peace and reconciliation to the area.

                      <li> in <strong>2010</strong>, the same year as the conflict resolution effort, he was chosen as a parliamentarian representing the Agaro Woreda.</li>

                      <li>By <strong>2014</strong>, in a rapid succession of degrees and a flurry of activities involving his job as a parliamentarian, Abiy added to this by becoming the Director General of a government funded research institute named the
                        Science and Technology Information Center.</li>
                    </li>
                    <li>A year later in 2015, it was crystal clear, that Abiy Ahmed was unstoppable in his rise through the ranks of Ethiopian politics. </li>

                    <li>In <strong>2016</strong>, Abiy’s unstoppable rise to power continued as he was made Deputy President of the Oromia Region under Lemma Megersa the president</li>

                    <p>By Februrary 2018, after 3 years of instability within the country, the then Prime Minister of Ethiopia Hailemariam Desalegn, in a shocking and unexpected move, announced on national television the following:Desalegn’s resignation
                      brought forth a fervently contested leadership election for the first time in EPRDF history. Pundits placed Lemma Megersa and Abiy Ahmed as favorites for the leadership position, but unfortunately Ethiopian law requires the Prime
                      Minister to have served in parliament. Lemma, the overwhelmingly favorite of the public never served in parliament while Abiy had. So in a strategic bid made by the OPDO in order not to lose their chance of attaining the leadership
                      position they sought, replaced Lemma with Abiy as Chairman of OPDO. The EPRDF, a coalition of four groups each sent in 45 members to vote for the next prime minister of Ethiopia. Abiy’s main competitor was the Amhara (AMDM) party’s
                      leader Demeke Mekonnen, but in a move believed to be a show of support for Abiy’s bid, Demeke only a few hours before the election, dropped out. This left the Southern Peoples (SEPDM) leader Shiferaw Shigute and Tigray’s (TPLF) leader
                      Debretsion Gebremichael as his competitors. On March 27, 2018, Abiy received 108 votes, while Shiferaw got 58 and Debretsion only 2. Six days later, Dr. Abiy Ahmed was made Prime Minister of Ethiopia by the House of Representatives
                      and sworn in.
